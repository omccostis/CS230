# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a company that is looking to expand their existing android game (Draw It or Lose It) into a web-based application available on a variety of platforms. The Draw It or Lose It application can run multiple game sessions simulataneously and supports various teams and players within a game session. Game, team, and player names must all be unique. Clue images must be rendered quickly and efficiently. User data should be protected and only accessible by authorized users. Users should have a consistent experience regardless of their platform or hardware.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

The software design document is well organized and consistent, which allows the client or collaborators to find important design specifications. Recommendations are clear and can be used throughout development to ensure compliance with business requirements.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Defining the requirements of the application before the design phase made for an outline to follow, accounting for the main functionality of the program and requiring less changes and reworks during testing.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

More detail could be added to the UML diagram describing the system architecture in more detail. Especially by making it clear what is performed by the client and what is performed by the server.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I dedicated time to make the image rendering process well-thought out to account for a wide variety of users and client hardware, ensuring a consitent experience, which is important for an application that can be run on many different machines.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

The process began with defining the overall business requirements before refining them into the technical and specific functionality of the program. By incrementally planning out the system architecture behind Draw It or Lose It, we ensured the development of the application will align closely with The Gaming Room's requirements and specifications.
